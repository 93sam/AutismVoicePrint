This is a study conducted with a team of students under Prof Lawrence Saul, UCSD

Research Literature: 

Research studies prove that there is a strong correlation between austistic behavior and nasality in voice (of all ages). References:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750946715000744

Objective:

Generate a nasality index for a given speech sample

Approach: 

Filter out low energy and aperiodic samples (underlying assumption: such samples cannot be nasalized). Run FFT on the remaining speech samples and use these as features for a classifier/neural network/HMM
